## 1️⃣ Urban Street Emission Study

**Objective:** Estimate emissions for mixed traffic in a 2-lane urban street during peak hours.

**Input Data Highlights:**  
- Total vehicles: 65  
- Fleet composition: Petrol 61%, Diesel 39%  
- Average speed: 35–40 km/h  
- Road slope: 0–2%  
- Daily traffic profile: Morning & evening peaks  

**Output Data Highlights:**  
| Vehicle Type | CO (g/km) | NOx (g/km) | PM (g/km) | VOC (g/km) | CO2 (g/km) |
|--------------|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Passenger Car Petrol | 0.45 | 0.10 | 0.005 | 0.12 | 120 |
| Passenger Car Diesel | 0.35 | 0.25 | 0.01  | 0.08 | 150 |
| Bus Diesel           | 0.80 | 0.50 | 0.05  | 0.15 | 400 |
| Motorcycle Petrol    | 0.10 | 0.02 | 0.001 | 0.05 | 50  |

**Total Emissions (per km):**  
- CO2: 1700 g/km  
- NOx: 45 g/km  
- PM: 2 g/km

## 📄 Report Summary
- **Peak hours** show 20–25% higher emissions than average  
- CO2 major contributor: Diesel buses  
- **Signal optimization & EV penetration** could reduce total CO2 by ~15–20%  
- Copert 5.5 proves reliable for urban traffic emission modeling
